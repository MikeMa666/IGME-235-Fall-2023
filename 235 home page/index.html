    <p id="brief-bio">My name is Yuxiang Ma, and I am currently a sophomore at RIT. As a game design major, my biggest interest is of
        course about games, I like to play FPS, Moba, and horror games. My greatest pleasure is playing and discussing
        games with my friends. I want to learn more about the direct connection between games and the web from this
        class, and I haven't figured out my future path yet, but it's definitely game-related.</p>
